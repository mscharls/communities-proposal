<p class="margin-top">Hi Daniel & Sam</p>

<br>

<p> First off, thank you for considering <span>Trip by Numbers</span> for this project.   With over 10 years experience in system design and process improvement, I excel at understanding, translating and operationalising complex business processes through the use of innovative technology systems.  <br><br> I have been working exclusively on the Salesforce platform for over 4 years and my passion for what it can do and how it <span>enables businesses </span> continues to grow. <br><br>Myself and my offshore team have immense skills and capabilities in delivering and implementing <span>Salesforce</span> to support businesses in their digital transformation.  By leveraging the global workforce to deliver the technical aspects of the project whilst I provide dedicated onshore support and guidance, we can deliver a user-friendly and technically proficient solution whilst <span>keeping costs manageable</span>. <br><br> I look forward to working closely with you and your team in Melbourne <p>Kind Regards,</p>

  <h1>Services</h1>
  <br>
  <p>All project management services are included for any required additional development team members.  Task deadline management for internal Adapt staff members is included for any additional required inputs such as design assets, decisions, contract execution etc.</p>
  <br>
   <p><span>1. Research</span></p>
   <br>
  <p>The outputs from this phase will be:
  <li>A full list of user stories with priority rankings based on importance, effort and cost</li>
  <li>A full understanding of the existing security and sharing models set up in Adapt's production Org</li>
  <li>Identification of sandbox environment for development</li>
  <br></p>

   <p><span>2. Design</span></p>
   <br>
   <p>The outputs from this phase will be:
   <li>Full Solution Design including wireframes and any required customer journey mapping</li>
   <li>Scope and analysis of third party applications required to extend functionality to desired level</li>
   <li>Breakdown of additional licensing costs for third party applications</li>
   <li>Internal user access defined</li>
   <li>Development strategy, timelines, defined sprints and any required team members</li>
   <br></p>


   <p><span>3. Develop</span></p>
  <p><span>4. Test</span></p>
   <p><span>5. Train</span></p>
   <p><span>6. Deploy</span></p>
   <br>
   <p>The outputs from these phases will be:
   <li>Continued development and resolution of user stories through Agile sprints</li>
   <li>Implementation and configuration of third party applications</li>
   <li>Testing on all functionality, security and sharing</li>
   <li>Browser and device testing</li>
   <li>System configuration documentation</li>
   <li>Internal user training sessions on delivered functionality</li>
   <li>One month post go-live support</li>
   <br></p>
 <br>
    <p><span>Not Included</span></p>
    <li>Configuration of Service Cloud features such as Case Management and Live Agent (Lightning or Classic Knowledge configurations is included)</li>
    <li>Creation of highly customised templates from scratch*</li>
    <li>Creation of internal training manuals</li>
    <li>Changes to scope not agreed to in writing</li>
    <li>Custom Lightning component development not agreed to in writing</li>

<p>*Whilst ample customisations are avaliable, excessive use of CSS styling can be detrimental to a maintainable community as with each package update release, CSS code will need to be reviewed, revised and re-written prior to new features becoming available.</p>

   <p><span>Charlotte Hailey</span></p>
   <br>
   <p>I will play a central role in owning and achieving on-time delivery of the project. I will be very hands on throughout the project, interacting with the Adapt Product Owner and liaising with your Salesforce Account Executive to ensure access to features and licenses is granted as required. I will also play a central role in negotiating and liaising with any third party developers or applications teams for any third party integrations that are required.  In the small chance that custom APEX or Lightning development is required that is beyond my technical skill set, I will engage my team of off-shore Salesforce Partner Developers.</p>
  <br><br>
   <p><span>Adapt Product Owner</span></p>
   <br>
   <p>This person will be an Adapt employee and the deciding voice in the direction of the Community Development.  Decisions such as feature prioritisation, third party application costs, changes to scope, internal user access, sharing models and security will be made by this person.  They may delegate responsibility internally for specific decisons, by doing so in writing.  An example of this would be delegating the choice of colours, banner images and other design aspects to the internal marketing person.  This would not include delegating any decisions of a material nature to subordinates, such as decisions surrounding key functionality.<p>
