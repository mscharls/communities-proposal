<p class="margin-top">Hi Ben</p>
<br>
<p> First off, thank you for considering me for this project.  I have been working on the Salesforce platform for 3 years now and my passion for what it can do and how it <span>enables businesses </span> continues to grow. <br><br>In particular my love for both the Community Cloud and Service Cloud has lead me to become a fully qualified consultant in both of these areas.  I have a great deal of understanding and experience in how to utilise the <span>extensive suite of out of the box functionality</span> to engineer engaging customer experiences.  <br><br>Additionally my focus in the area of education has exposed me to the demands of this industry; from structured online learning to free-form content delivery.  This has given me the opportunity to implement several <span>best in class applications</span> to further extend the core functionality of both products.  <br><br>Adept customers will love how easy, intuitive and responsive the Community interface is and your internal teams will appreciate the 360 degree view it provides of your customers, from right within their lightning App.  As your Salesforce consultant for this project I look forward to developing this platform and aligning to your unique needs</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>

        <div id="phases" class="hide">
<h1>Phases</h1>

<p>The project will be consist of 6 key phases each with distinct goals and outcomes.</p>
<br>
 <p><span>1. Research</span></p>

 <p>During this phase the key goals are to gain a full understanding of Adept's requirements from both a customer facing point of view and an internal users point of view.  It is during this stage that user stories will be developed in consultation with the Adept Product Owner.
<br><br>
  A full list of user stories that define existing out of the box functionality will be provided during this consulation period so that the Adept Product Owner can quickly identify the core use cases and decide which of these will be required and with what importance.
<br><br>
  Additionally a set of industry specific user stories will also be supplied.  This will provide the Adept Product owner a jumping-off point for further indepth discussions about the potential for the solution.
<br><br>
  Finally a full audit of Adept's curent Salesforce implementation, including security and sharing, development lifecycle and existing installed applications.  This is to enable a clear path forward regarding system configuration to prepare your org for redefined sharing models required to allow external users access to their private customer data and other Communities functionality.</p>
<br><br>

 <p><span>2. Design</span></p>
 <br>
 <p>With a strong focus on user story priorities, a full solution design will be created.  This will include a deliniation between implimentation and customisation of out of the box Communities functionality and any additional third party packaged applications that will be required to provide the desired functionality.
 <br>
 <br>
 In the event that additional third party applications are required, a full audit and analysis of any packages that I am unfamiliar with will be included; this is limited to technical functionality only. Any ROI analysis of additional costs can be provided, at an additional charge.
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>Internal user processes will also be defined, such as external user establishment and management,  internal profile permissions and accessibility to data.  Required design assets will also be defined based on the development of basic UI Wireframes.  Existing templated Community layouts will be explored and if required a custom built template can be discussed.
 <br>
 <br>
  Importantly, this phase will also define the development strategy, team and timelines in greater detail.  The development approach will be <span>Agile</span> and broken into a series of sprints.  The length and number of sprints and required team members will be defined at this stage. </p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><span>3. Develop</span></p>
<p><span>4. Test</span></p>
 <p><span>5. Train</span></p>
 <p><span>6. Deploy</span></p>
 <br>
 <p>Using the <span>Agile</span> method of development, core system requirements including internal org wide settings will be completed before the development sprints are commenced.
 <br>
 <br>
 This will be followed by a series of sprints designed to deliver incremental functionality deliveries for testing.  Once functionality is approved, required internal users are trained, the development is deployed.
 <br>
 <br>
 Depending on the desired go-live date, deployment may only be to internal and testing users.
