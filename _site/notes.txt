Couple of updates.



Confirming we are going down the Communities path, we have purchased a single member license just to enable the platform.
We have an event tomorrow, so later this week or next week we will explore the platform to get a feel for it.
With Service Hub, I am still thinking about as while we would get it free now it would still come at a cost at the end of our current licensing period (June 2020), so need to do some research and future planning. Will make a decision on this in the next week.
We would like this live by end of Jan


Happy setup a more detailed needs analysis discussion, if you can give me a brief of what you will be expecting in this session and I can ensure we are prepared and the right people are present.



Also, can you send me a proposal with the following

Rough project plan (high level), bullet points is fine
Services you can provide
Costings breakdown for each service
What resources (people, time, skill sets etc) will be needed from our side
How we will work with you e.g. Hours of day, planning sessions, scrums sessions.
