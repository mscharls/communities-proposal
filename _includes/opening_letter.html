<p class="margin-top">Hi Ben</p>
<br>
<p> First off, thank you for considering me for this project.  I have been working on the Salesforce platform for 3 years now and my passion for what it can do and how it <span>enables businesses </span> continues to grow. <br><br>In particular my love for both the Community Cloud and Service Cloud has lead me to become a fully qualified consultant in both of these areas.  I have a great deal of understanding and experience in how to utilise the <span>extensive suite of out of the box functionality</span> to engineer engaging customer experiences.  <br><br>Additionally my focus in the area of education has exposed me to the demands of this industry; from structured online learning to free-form content delivery.  This has given me the opportunity to implement several <span>best in class applications</span> to further extend the core functionality of both products.  <br><br>Adapt customers will love how easy, intuitive and responsive the Community interface is and your internal teams will appreciate the 360 degree view it provides of your customers, right from within their Lightning app.  As your Salesforce consultant for this project I look forward to developing this platform and aligning to your unique needs.</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
