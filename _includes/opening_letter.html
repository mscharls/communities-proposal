<p class="margin-top">Hi Daniel & Sam</p>

<br>

<p> First off, thank you for considering <span>Trip by Numbers</span> for this project.   With over 10 years experience in system design and process improvement, I excel at understanding, translating and operationalising complex business processes through the use of innovative technology systems.  <br><br> I have been working exclusively on the Salesforce platform for over 4 years and my passion for what it can do and how it <span>enables businesses </span> continues to grow. <br><br>Myself and my offshore team have immense skills and capabilities in delivering and implementing <span>Salesforce</span> to support businesses in their digital transformation.  By leveraging the global workforce to deliver the technical aspects of the project whilst I provide dedicated onshore support and guidance, we can deliver a user-friendly and technically proficient solution whilst <span>keeping costs manageable</span>. <br><br> I look forward to working closely with you and your team in Melbourne <p>Kind Regards,</p>
